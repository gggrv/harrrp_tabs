  background: >
    An obvious cry for help, ignoring it is impossible.
    Access to reliably transcribed lyrics could shed more light into the song's actual meaning.
    The lyrical hero appears to be a self-conscious boaster.
    In their desperate attempts to prove their worth,
    they repeatedly cause trouble and barely withstand
    an overwhelming sense of fear and shame that naturally emerges afterwards.
    Precise, sharp, methodical harmonica performance can highlight
    explosive pain and frustration, depicted in this melody.
