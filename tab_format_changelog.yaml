# harmonica tabs format changelog
# newer version is added to the top of the document
# purpose of this format:
# - preserve flexibility and simplicity of human-readable harmonica tabs
# - explicitly state which harmonica is being used in the most unambiguous way possible
# - carefully and respectfully handle all relevant credits
# - allow beginners to easily access and appropriate written harmonica tabs for personal needs
# - allow to programmatically switch between different harps / octaves
# - allow to programmatically switch to a different notation (i.e. render html/txt/pdf/??, use custom note labels)
# - allow to programmatically detect song difficulty
# drawbacks of this format:
# - no precise note timing information - user needs to have an external audio or be familiar with the song
# - widechar symbols in the `map/%song part%/%paragraph%/%line%/%text%` require additional parameter in order to be synchronized with the `map/%song part%/%paragraph%/%line%/%hole%` due to the fact that different text editors render widechar symbols differently
# - redundant quotations are needed in order to safely define strings that contain yaml-specific symbols
# - additional programmatical tests are needed in order to ensure validity of yaml structure
